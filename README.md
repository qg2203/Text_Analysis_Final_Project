# Text_Analysis_Final_Project

The global business landscape is witnessing a significant shift towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations, reflecting a growing awareness of sustainability and responsible business practices. Innovations that prioritize ESG criteria are more likely to benefit society and the environment while creating companies' long-term value. This research project aims to explore the relationship between a company's ESG performance and its innovation capabilities. By examining how companies communicate and implement ESG principles in their innovation efforts, this research can contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics between sustainability and innovation. Furthermore, this project will contribute to a better understanding of how ESG practices influence innovation and vice versa, as it holds implications for sustainable business practices, corporate growth, and public policy.
